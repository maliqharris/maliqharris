As a visually oriented individual, I possess a keen eye for design and strive to create captivating and user-friendly interfaces. Combining my front-end and back-end development expertise, I am well-equipped to handle the entire development process. Proficient in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am also experienced in working with frameworks such as React and Node.js.
